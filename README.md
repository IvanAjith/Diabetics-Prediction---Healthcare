# Diabetics-Prediction---Healthcare
Build a model to accurately predict whether the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not?


The following tasks were done  

1.	Performed descriptive analysis and found that the minimum value of the below-listed columns cannot be zero (0)? On these columns, a value of zero does not make sense and thus indicates a missing value.
•	Glucose
•	BloodPressure
•	SkinThickness
•	Insulin
•	BMI

2.	Visually explored these variable, using histograms. Treat the missing values accordingly.

3.	 Observed integer as well as float data-type of variables in this dataset. Created a count (frequency) plot describing the data types and the count of variables. 

4.	Checked the balance of the data by plotting the count of outcomes by their value.

5.	Created scatter charts between the pair of variables to understand the relationships

6.	Performed correlation analysis. Visually explored it using a heat map.

7.	Devised strategies for model building.

8.	Apply an appropriate classification algorithm to build a model and Compared various models with the results from KNN.

9.	Created a classification report by analyzing sensitivity, specificity, AUC(ROC curve), etc.
